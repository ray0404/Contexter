# Contexter

Contexter is a powerful suite of Python command-line tools for packaging, reconstructing, and updating software projects as single, portable Markdown or HTML files. This workflow is perfect for sharing entire projects with AI models, creating simple text-based backups, or transferring projects between machines.

## New in This Version: AI Workflow âœ…

We've added a `sanitizecontext` command to fix common formatting errors when you copy a full project context from an AI chat. Since AI models can sometimes forget to add code fences (````), this tool makes the output instantly usable.

**New Workflow:**
1.  Paste the AI's response into `ai_output.md`.
2.  Run: `sanitize_context ai_output.md clean_project.md`
3.  Reconstruct: `reconstructor clean_project.md ./my-new-project`
