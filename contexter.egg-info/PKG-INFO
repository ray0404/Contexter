# Contexter

Contexter is a powerful suite of Python command-line tools for packaging, 
reconstructing, and updating software projects as single, portable Markdown or 
HTML files. This workflow is perfect for sharing entire projects with AI 
models, creating simple text-based backups, or transferring projects between 
machines.

## New in This Version: AI Workflow ✅

We've added a `sanitizecontext` command to fix common formatting errors when 
you copy a full project context from an AI chat. Since AI models can sometimes 
forget to add code fences (````), this tool makes the output instantly usable.

**New Workflow:**
1.  Paste the AI's response into `ai_output.md`.
2.  Run: `sanitizecontext ai_output.md clean_project.md`
3.  Reconstruct: `reconstructor clean_project.md ./my-new-project`

## Installation

You can install Contexter using `pip`. It is recommended to install it in a 
virtual environment.

### Standard Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

### Development Installation

If you want to edit the source code and have your changes immediately 
reflected, use the "editable" install mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` and 
create command-line entries for the Contexter tools.
